    "The problem of predicting oneâ€™s illnesses wrongly through self-diagnosis in medicine is very real. In a report by the [Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/11760658/One-in-four-self-diagnose-on-the-internet-instead-of-visiting-the-doctor.html), nearly one in four self-diagnose instead of visiting the doctor. Out of those who misdiagnose, nearly half have misdiagnosed their illness wrongly [reported](https://bigthink.com/health/self-diagnosis/). While there could be multiple root causes to this problem, this could stem from a general unwillingness and inability to seek professional help.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elevent percent of the respondents surveyed, for example, could not find an appointment in time. This means that crucial time is lost during the screening phase of a medical treatment, and early diagnosis which could have resulted in illnesses treated earlier was not achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the knowledge of which medical specialty area to focus on, a patient can receive targeted help much faster through consulting specialist doctors. To alleviate waiting times and predict which area of medical specialty to focus on, we can utilize natural language processing (NLP) to solve this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given any medical transcript or patient condition, this solution would predict the medical specialty that the patient should seek help in. Ideally, given a sufficiently comprehensive transcript (and dataset), one would be able to predict exactly which illness he is suffering from."

    "The <code>preprocessing</code> function takes a sentence, removes hyperlinks, performs various token-level filters (removing stop words, symbols, punctuation marks, and whitespace), lemmatizes the remaining tokens to their base forms, and returns the cleaned sentence as a string. Specifically, the code <code>token.pos_ != 'SYM' and token.pos_ != 'PUNCT' and token.pos_ != 'SPACE'</code> checks if the token's part-of-speech (POS) tag is not 'SYM' (symbol), 'PUNCT' (punctuation), or 'SPACE'. It further filters out tokens that are symbols, punctuation marks, or represent whitespace. We also appended the lowercase lemma (base form) of the token, obtained using <code>token.lemma_</code>, to the cleaned_tokens list."

Her history is also significant for likely recurrent aspiration pneumonia and intubation earlier on this admission as well.  Previously while treating this patient I had met with the family and discussed how aggressive the patient would wish her level of care to be given that there was evidence of possible ovarian malignancy with elevated CA-125 and a complex mass located in the ovary.  As the patient was showing signs of improvement with some speech and ability to follow commands, decision was made to continue to pursue an aggressive level of care, treat her dysphagia, hypertension, debilitation and this was being done.  However, last night the patient had apparently catastrophic event around 2:40 in the morning.  Rapid response was called and the patient was intubated, started on pressure support, and given CPR.  This morning I was called to the bedside by nursing stating the family had wished at this point not to continue this aggressive level of care.  The patient was seen and examined, she was intubated and sedated.  Limbs were cool.  Cardiovascular exam revealed tachycardia.  Lungs had coarse breath sounds.  Abdomen was soft.  Extremities were cool to the touch.  Pupils were 6 to 2 mm, doll\\'s eyes were not intact.  They were not responsive to light.  Based on discussion with all family members involved including both sons, daughter and daughter-in-law, a decision was made to proceed with terminal wean and comfort care measures.  All pressure support was discontinued.  The patient was started on intravenous morphine and respiratory was requested to remove the ET tube.  Monitors were turned off and the patient was made as comfortable as possible.  Family is at the bedside at this time.  The patient appears comfortable and the family is in agreement that this would be her wishes per my understanding of the family and the patient dynamics over the past month, this is a very reasonable and appropriate approach given the patient\\'s failure to turn around after over a month of aggressive treatment with likely terminal illness from ovarian cancer and associated comorbidities.,Total time spent at the bedside today in critical care services, medical decision making and explaining options to the family and proceeding with terminal weaning was excess of 37 minutes.\",\"hospice - palliative care, full code status, terminal wean, comfort care, cpr, advanced cardiac life support, care conference, family, bedsideNOTE,: Thesetranscribed medical transcription sample reports and examples are provided by various users andare for reference purpose only.
